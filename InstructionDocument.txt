As you can see in the above example of an adventure document, the format is as follows

A number followed by a colon(:) e.g. 1:
This represents the situation's ID.

Some text to display to the player about the current situation they are in,
This can be a many lines as you like and will end with a line containing //

The lines following the // are the option lines. Each line will represent a single option,
the options are in the format
text @GOTO NextSituationID

There must always be at least one option line, however you can have as many as you choose.

If you wish to automatically proceed from one situation to another without user input, 
use the format
@GOTO NextSituationID

Should you wish a situation to end the game, 
you should give the situation an option line containing
only the word "END"

When you have finished adding options for a situation, add // to the following line.
This is not required for the final option in the document.

Note: 
@GOTO is case sensitive
END is case sensitive
